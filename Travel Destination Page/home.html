        <h2>Mainpat</h2>
        <img src="images/mainpat.jpg" alt="Mainpat">
        <p>Mainpat is an underrated hill station with green pastures, deep valleys, breathtaking waterfalls, dense
            forests and untouched rivulets. The hill station hasn’t been completely commercialised yet and receives a
            relatively smaller influx of tourists compared to its counterparts. Mainpat is often called as Shimla of
            Chhattisgarh and Mini Tibet owing to its huge Tibetan population and influence over the area. The Tibetan
            refugees were rehabilitated in Mainpat after the Chinese invasion of Tibet and have since found a home in
            Mainpat. That’s another great thing about Mainpat, the confluence of cultures and diverse traditions only
            add to the picturesque village’s charm.</p>
